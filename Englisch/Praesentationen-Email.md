## Englisch Präsentationen: E-Mails von Prof. Doppelbauer

```
presentations will be part of the grades (in consequence - few or hardly any exams?!)
set up a presentations on:  

alternative and fossil energy forms as onp 62 ( also: wave Energy, tidal energy, offshore windfarms, etc ….)  - include criticsm. 

all the consequences of: C02 and gases in the atmosphere - ways of cutting down its generation, ways how to reduce it
(pump it into the ground, the sea or are there some realistic ones ?), 

fracking  - consequences, how much is done, gets sold to ?, etc.
other forms you can think of.

Send your ideas / choices to me and a rough concept of your presentation as overlapping should be be avoided,
the decisions should be made early - helps with organising

a few weeks are allowed for setting up the presentation itself

as you are the class representative of a rather big class I decided to tell you a few other topics for the presentations:

any Kind of Pollution as noise -, light pollution.

Pollution of the soil, landscape, air, water: acquifers  (Gewässer)

Climate change included: 

when it started, how, how it turned worse, where in the world it is the worst, its effects,

what could be done to recover it /them - by governments, EU, companies,  individuals, schools should be involved?

I was sure that I allowed that you do bigger presentations together - as pairs.

if a student make this presentation by himself then I can be sure that I grade his achievement and not his partner's one.

Discuss who will take which topic.

You can also take climate change – how to combat it, further energy saving buildings (also of companies) – old form is the passive house – pp 84-85, clean cars, planes - besides the forms of pollution and forms of energy.
